You move the paddle with w and s and you also have 2 power-ups per game:

## Power-Ups
1. "Fireball" **F** wich straightens the ball and gives it a speed of 10 (the speed limit is 20 and default is 5)
2. "Bouncy Wall" **E** wich makes the middle line collidable and bounces the ball back to the side where it came from.

### general info about the game
The ball and the paddles are rounded so if you hit the ball with the rounded corners the ball gains or loses speed depending on your direction
There a two triangles in the map on the middle line so the ball doesn't get stuck on the top or bottom of the wall.
