# pong

This is a pong game used to learn about coding and networking with unity.
This game works with one player connecting to a server and the second player joining the first one.

## The Goal of the Game
The goal is to score 20 goals or to have more goals than the opponent after the time limit of 3 minutes.
You move the paddle with w and s and you also have 2 power-ups per game:

## Power-Ups
1. "Fireball" **F** wich straightens the ball and gives it a speed of 10 (the speed limit is 20 and default is 5)
2. "Bouncy Wall" **E** wich makes the middle line magenta, collidable and bounces the ball back to the side where it came from.
   (as seen in the example below)

### general info about the game
The ball and the paddles are rounded so if you hit the ball with the rounded corners the ball gains or loses speed depending on your direction.  
There a two triangles in the map on the middle line so the ball doesn't get stuck on the top or bottom of the wall.
